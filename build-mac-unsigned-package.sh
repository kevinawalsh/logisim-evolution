# This script is for building the final MacOS executable image. This is a
# comically complicated procedure, for many reasons:
# - Everything below Java 11 is becoming quickly obsolete and difficult to
#   support. Libraries and tools are disappearing, packages won't install, etc.
#   Solution: Use Java 11, at least for now.
# - Homebrew installs a broken version of AdoptOpenJDK-11 (as of Aug 13, 2018).
#   The jmod files included in the install contain the wrong sha256 hashes, so
#   jlink fails when attempting to build the modularized java-runtime.
#   Workaround: Install AdoptOpenJDK-11 by downloading the mac tar.gz directly
#   from github, copy into /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.4+11,
#   fix the ownership and permissions, and hope for the best.
# - JDK-11 does not include javapackager, jpackager, jpackage, or any similar
#   tools. There appears to be no official way to package java applications as
#   of JDK 11, and there will not be until Java 13 at the earliest. Yes, this
#   seems incomprehensible that there could be no way to package a java
#   application for distribution any more.
#   There is an unofficial backported jpackager tool discussed here:
#   https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/openjfx-dev/2018-September/022500.html
#   It is also possible to install early access JDK 14 (or early access JDK 13),
#   which come with a new jpackage tool, which apparently can be used to package
#   files created with JDK 11. Both of these appear to be broken in various
#   ways: the backport can't deal with license files correctly, and neither sets
#   the permissions correctly on the installed files
#   However, this appears to be broken in several ways: 
# - MacOS is becoming increasingly (and rapidly) more strict about running code
#   from unsigned/unofficial sources. It seems that the most recent versions of
#   MacOS may not be able to run unsigned sources at all, at least not without
#   extensive warnings and fiddling with security settings in likely unsafe
#   ways. It appears to no longer be tenable to ship unsigned code for MacOS.
#   Solution: Get developer keys and sign MacOS installers / executables.
# - Apple's University Developer Program claims to allow for obtaining
#   appropriate keys. However, the documentation for creating these keys is
#   vague, outdated, and contradictory, at best, and an extended back-and-forth
#   with our university account holder and with Apple yields no results. It
#   seems that the necessary signing keys are simply no longer possible to
#   generate within the University Developer Program.
#   Workaround: Use a paid, Individual Apple Developer account to obtain signing
#   keys.
# - My current AppleID is enrolled in our University Developer Program. Apple
#   confirms that each AppleID can be enrolled in at most one developer program.
#   Workaround: Create and use a separate AppleID for just Logisim Evolution.
#   Also work on an entirely fresh Mac hardware and account, since the AppleID
#   is engrained fairly thoroughly in MacOS.
# - jpackage (via Apple's pkgbuild/productbuild) does not set file permissions
#   (chmod) correctly on the installed application by default. jpackage does not
#   appear to have a way to pass custom arguments to pkgbuild/productbuild, and
#   it isn't clear there are any options that would help (the "preserve file
#   ownership" options might, but that doesn't say anything about preserving
#   file permissions).
#   Workaround: use a postinstall script to chmod all the files to reasonable
#   permissions.
